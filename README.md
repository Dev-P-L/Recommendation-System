# Recommendation System

This Data Science project is a response to the first challenge 
from the Capstone Examination PH125.9x organized by Harvard University on edX.
It has been a milestone towards obtaining their Professional Certificate in Data Science.

* This project is about predicting ratings. It is based on the 10-million-observation data set from MovieLens (see *https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/* ).

* The programming language is R. Code is in *Recommendation_Script.R* and *Recommendation_Report.Rmd*. The final report exists in two versions: *Recommendation_Report.html* and *Recommendation_Report.pdf*. 

* Wishing to visualize *Recommendation_Report.pdf*? Very easy: just download it from GitHub.

* Wishing to visualize *Recommendation_Report.html*?
  * You could activate the hyperlink *https://dev-p-l.github.io/Cohort-Analysis/70_cohort_analysis_final_report.html* .
