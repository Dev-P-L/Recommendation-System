# Recommendation System

This Data Science project in R is a response to the first challenge 
from Capstone Examination PH125.9x organized by Harvard University on edX 
for their Professional Certificate in Data Science.

This project is about predicting ratings. It is based on the 10-million-observation data set from MovieLens (see https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ ).

Code is in Recommendation_Script.R and Recommendation_Report.Rmd. 

The final report exists in two versions: Recommendation_Report.html and Recommendation_Report.pdf.
