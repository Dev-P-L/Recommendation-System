# Recommendation System

This Data Science project in R is a response to the first challenge 
from Capstone Examination PH125.9x organized by Harvard University on edX 
for their Professional Certificate in Data Science.

* This project is about predicting ratings. It is based on the 10-million-observation data set from MovieLens (see https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ ).

* Code is in Recommendation_Script.R and Recommendation_Report.Rmd. The final report exists in two versions: Recommendation_Report.html and Recommendation_Report.pdf. 

* Wishing to visualize Report.pdf? Very easy: just download it from GitHub.

* Wishing to visualize Report.html?

  * You could open it in GitHub Desktop.

 * Alternatively, you could use the URL https://rawcdn.githack.com/Dev-P-L/Bank-Marketing/17b63a112231f23fa7729ed62b9a5998b0a1adad/Report.html which, when activated, delivers Report.html to the browser with the correct Content-Type headers and not with Content-Type of text/plain. The URL has been obtained by introducing the GitHub URL of Report.html into https://raw.githack.com/ , as suggested in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6551446/can-i-run-html-files-directly-from-github-instead-of-just-viewing-their-source .

  * Alternatively again, you could knit Report.Rmd or ask me by email for a copy of Report.html.
