# Recommendation System

This Data Science project in R is a response to the first challenge 
from Capstone Examination PH125.9x organized by Harvard University on edX 
for their Professional Certificate in Data Science.

The main part of input data is extracted by Recommendation_Script.R. 
The two CSV files are comprised of some additional results. 

The final report exists in two versions: Recommendation_Report.html and Recommendation_Report.pdf. 

It has been produced by the R Mardown file Recommendation_Report.Rmd and by Recommendation_Script.R. 

The whole working of this project is further explained in both versions of the final report. 
More specifically, to get information about the project itself, 
please read “I – Introductory Section” also from Recommendation_Report.pdf.

Readers who are interested in running the programs from this project should first read “Important Foreword – Requirements” from both versions of the final report.
