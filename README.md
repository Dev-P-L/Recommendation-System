# Recommendation-System

This is a response to the first challenge from Capstone Examination PH125.9x 
organized by Harvard University on edX for their Professional Certificate in Data Science. 

The file bank.csv is comprised of all input data.

The final report exists in two versions: Report.htlm and Report.pdf.

It has been produced in R Mardown by the file Report.Rmd. All code is included in Report.Rmd.

The code is also contained in an R script, i.e. in Script.R. Script.R contains more technical comments than the R Markdown file Report.Rmd.

Readers who are interested in running the programs from this project should first 
read “Important Foreword – Requirements” from Recommendation_Report.pdf. 

To get information about the project itself, please read “I – Introductory Section” 
also from Recommendation_Report.pdf.
