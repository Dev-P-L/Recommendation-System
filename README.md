# Recommendation System

This Data Science project is a response to the first challenge 
from the Capstone Examination PH125.9x organized by Harvard University on edX.
It has been a milestone towards obtaining their Professional Certificate in Data Science.

* This project is about predicting ratings. It is based on the 10-million-observation data set from MovieLens (see https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ ).

* The programming language is R. Code is in Recommendation_Script.R and Recommendation_Report.Rmd. The final report exists in two versions: Recommendation_Report.html and Recommendation_Report.pdf. 

* Wishing to visualize Recommendation_Report.pdf? Very easy: just download it from GitHub.

* Wishing to visualize Recommendation_Report.html?

  * You could open it in GitHub Desktop.

  * Alternatively, you could use the URL https://rawcdn.githack.com/Dev-P-L/Recommendation-System/2647d4648902adda3344b45c228c0d8f9bcd8fe3/Recommendation_Report.html which, when activated, delivers Recommendation_Report.html to the browser with the correct Content-Type headers. The URL has been obtained by introducing the GitHub URL of Recommendation_Report.html into https://raw.githack.com/ , as suggested in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6551446/can-i-run-html-files-directly-from-github-instead-of-just-viewing-their-source .

  * Alternatively again, you could knit Recommendation_Report.Rmd or ask me by email for a copy of Recommendation_Report.html.
